## Built with...

• R (regsubsets) 

## File Dictionary 

• <b>MATH2831 Assignment Code.R</b>:</b> R code used for determining the optimal linear model. </b>

• <b>MATH2831 - Assignment.pdf:</b> Final report containing R code and statistics. </b>

• <b>Assignment brief.pdf</b> Details of the questions and requirements of the assessment task. </b>

• <b>squid.txt</b> Dataset on experiment to study the size of squid eaten by sharks and tuna. </b>

## Motivation 

Requirements summary: 

<b> • Summary statistics of squid data set. </b>

<b> • Simple and Multiple Linear Regression. </b>

<b> • Determining the best model using adjusted R-squared, PRESS statistic and Mallows' Cp. </b>

<b> • Sequential variable selection, including forward and backward selection, as well as stepwise selection procedure. </b>

<b> • Model criticism - fitting a linear model and reporting diagnostic plots of residuals and commenting on appropriateness. </b> 

<b> • Derivation of Mallows' Cp statistic using mathematics. </b>

## Summary of Code

  • Plots of residuals and the results for forward, backward and stepwise selection procedures were computed using R and the derivation of Mallows' Cp statistic were completed
  by hand.
  
## Summary of Results

• Based on statistical analysis we have determined that the best model (AIC = -13.71) comprises of predictors x_5 and x_4. 

• When computing the various sequential variable selection, the model which yielded the smallest AIC value utilised backward selection method. 

• From the multiple linear regression output with predictors x_5 and x_4, the predictor x_4 is not statistically significant with a p-value of 0.0252, compared to x_5 with a p-value of 0.0000149 which is statistically significant.
